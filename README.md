# Genetic Algorithm AI
This repository contains the implementation of a Genetic Algorithm-based AI system. The project includes a virtual creature simulation using PyBullet, where various algorithms are implemented for creature movement, terrain generation, and genetic evolution. This project is part of my university midterm subject in Artificial Intelligence.

## Features
- Virtual Creature Simulation: Simulates creatures in a virtual environment.
- Genetic Algorithms: Implements genetic algorithms for evolving creatures over time.
- Terrain Generation: Generates various terrains for creature simulation.
- Movement Algorithms: Includes various algorithms for creature movement.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyBullet
- Other dependencies listed in requirements.txt

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/untari/genetic-algorithm-ai.git`
`cd genetic-algorithm-ai`
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   `python -m venv venv`
   `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the dependencies:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
To run the simulation, execute the following command:
`python cw-envt.py`
